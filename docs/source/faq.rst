**When/Why should I use iBridges instead of python-irodsclient/iCommands**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The python-irodsclient and the iCommands are much more powerful and expressive than iBridges. If you are already
intimately familiar with either of them, you probably don't need iBridges, since it doesn't add anything that isn't
already there. The target audience of iBridges is different: it tries to help researchers/users that are not
expert irods users. The learning curve of using iBridges is much easier than either of the two alternatives.
Additionally, you're less likely to mess up your data, since iBridges implements safer default options.

An advantage compared to the iCommands is that iBridges also works on Mac OS and Windows.
