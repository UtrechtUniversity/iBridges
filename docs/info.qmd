title: "What is iBridges"
---
iBridges is a standalone client software *desktop application*, written in **Python**, to provide users of *Windows, Linux and Mac* with a *graphical user interface* to interact with **iRODS** servers. 
The tool is agnostic to any rules/policies in the server. The out-of-the-box iBridges supports three main functions: browsing and manipulating data objects, upload/download data, and search through data collections. 

We also provide a commandline interface with which data can be uploaded and downloaded.

The GUI can be extended by users to implement their own data workflows.
