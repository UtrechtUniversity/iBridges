# iBridges CLI
The iBridges CLI is a commandline interface to up and download large amounts of data. It only updates data when necessary, i.e. if checksums of files differ.

## Configuration

- Minimal configuration file for uploading data to iRODs:

```ini
[iRODS]
irodsenv = /<path to>/irods_environment.json
irodscoll =
irodsresc =
webdav =
```

- Configuration file for downloading data from iRODS:

```ini
[iRODS]
irodsenv = /<path to>/irods_environment.json
irodscoll =
irodsresc =
webdav =

[DOWNLOAD]
path = /path/to/download/directory
```

- Configuration files for uploading data to iRODS and linking them to ElabJournal experiment:

```ini
  [iRODS]
  irodsenv = /<path to>/irods_environment.json
  irodscoll =
  irodsresc = bigstore
  webdav = http://scomp1486.wurnet.nl

  [ELN]
  token = wur.elabjournal.com;<some hash>
  group =
  experiment =
  title =
  ```

## Usage

```sh
./iBridgesCli.py -h
./iBridgesCli -c </path/to/config> -d </path/to/folder/or/file/to/upload>
./iBridgesCli.py -c </path/to/config> -i </zone/home/path/to/coll/or/obj>
